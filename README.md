Home Automation Server

This contains code that I'm writing as part of what is essentially V3 of my home automation project.

The core of this effort is going to be a REST service that uses verb-noun pairs to model home automation commands
where the nouns are things in and around the house.  With the core service in place, I intend to develop
other things to interact with it -- web apps on different platforms, desktop clients, phone apps -- whatever 
I feel like as I go.
